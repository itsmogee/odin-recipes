    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This variation on mushroom risotto includes cream of mushroom soup for the
      creamy taste, without actually using heavy cream. A light hand is
      recommended with the thyme and basil. If you like, stir in freshly grated
      parmesan cheese before serving.

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place dried mushrooms into a small bowl, and cover with hot water; soak
        10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, and gently squeeze dry with
        paper towels. Chop mushrooms, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop cream of mushroom into a bowl, and gradually stir in boiling water
        until mixture is smooth but not runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the stock to a gentle simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat butter and olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in
        onion, garlic, and chopped mushrooms; cook about 3 minutes. Gradually
        stir in rice; cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly to coat rice with
        oil.Season with salt and pepper. Stir in thyme and basil to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in mushroom soup mixture, stirring until absorbed. Gradually add
        1/3 stock , stirring until liquid is absorbed. Continue to stir in stock
        gradually, 1 cup at a time, allowing the liquid to be absorbed before
        adding another cup. It should take about 20 minutes for all the stock to
        be absorbed and the rice becomes al dente (tender but firm to the bite)
